Healthcare Monitoring System

Overview

The Healthcare Monitoring System is a comprehensive web-based application designed to streamline the management and monitoring of healthcare-related data. The system allows users to register, log in, and manage their profiles while providing a platform for storing and accessing health metrics. It integrates backend processing with MySQL, user-friendly frontend interfaces, and robust testing frameworks to deliver a seamless experience.
